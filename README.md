# Getting Started

If you haven't done so already, check out the [Deployed Web App](https://lifters-log.herokuapp.com/#/). This is currently free to use and was built with a responsive design so you can pull up the site on any device. The mobile app version is currently in production.

## What's it for?

Lifter's Log is designed to be a one-stop shop for individuals who take their weightlifting a little more seriously. Log in to save your PR (personal record) lifts and update whenever you hit a new max! If you save your lifts, you'll be able to use the My Percentage component which quickly gives you a percentage breakdown from 0-100% (in 5% increments) of whichever lift you choose. You can even select 2 lifts from different categories and have the percentages both show up side-by-side.

Regardless whether you make an account or not, you will have access to the Percentage Finder and Plate Math components. Percentage Finder allows you to input a weight and the percentage range you want that weight broken into. For example, if your program has you doing cleans from 65% to 85% of your 1RM. Plate Math helps by adding up all the weight on your bar and giving you the total weight. There are instructions at the top of the component so just follow them and let it do the work for you!

There are also some ideas I would like to include in the near future...hopefully on the mobile app. These can be found below.
